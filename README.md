# Firefox UWP Style

This is a visually simple theme that follows MDL2 styling with the accent color and gray-on-black elements, combines both while remaining original.

## Install

The theme uses OS-level dark/light setting to apply the correct colors. Light theme is not 100% finished, some rarely used pages may fallback to dark colors.

Firefox's density modes are supported but only the compact one has been thoroughly tested, if you see any issues please report them here.

Toggle `toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets` pref in `about:config` to enable both userChrome.css and userContent.css.

Select the branch that targets your version of Firefox.

- master > Nightly
- firefox-76 > Firefox 76 ~ 84.

### With Git

Go into your Firefox profile folder and clone the repo:
`git clone -b <branch> https://github.com/Guerra24/Firefox-UWP-Style.git chrome`

Replace `<branch>` with the one that targets your version of Firefox.

Now restart Firefox and the theme will be enabled.

Remember to check for newer branches as the supported one can change when firefox updates.

### Without Git

Download the code of the branch as ZIP, copy the content inside the folder(where userChrome.css file is located) into your chrome folder.

Now restart Firefox and the theme will be enabled.
