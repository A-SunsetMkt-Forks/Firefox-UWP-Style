# Firefox UWP Style

*Firefox UWP* is a more complete and robust theme that mimics UWP UI. Created with consistency and accuracy in mind, captures look and feel of UWP and brings it to Firefox. Based on *Firefox Flat-Dark UWP Style* theme, it expands the changes to context menus and most part of the UI.

## Install

Go into your Firefox profile folder and clone the repo:
`git clone -b <branch> https://github.com/Guerra24/Firefox-UWP-Style.git chrome`

Replace `<branch>` with the one that targets your version of Firefox:
- master > Nightly
- firefox-58 > Firefox 58, 59, 60, 61 & 62.

Now restart Firefox and the theme will be enabled, if you want to disable parts of it open `userChrome.css` and remove or comment the `@import` line of the module that you want to disable.

## Updates

I will provide updates for the Firefox releases that have support, this mean if a Firefox release goes out of support I will stop providing updates for that release. Example: when F59 launches, F58 stops receiving updates and so the theme.
