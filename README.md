# Firefox UWP Style

*Firefox UWP* is a more complete and robust theme that mimics UWP UI. Created with consistency and accuracy in mind, captures look and feel of UWP and brings it to Firefox. Based on *Firefox Flat-Dark UWP Style* theme, it expands the changes to context menus and most part of the UI.

## Install

This theme only supports the default Dark mode and Compact UI, selection of other type [in the customization page](https://puu.sh/AORte/1e2ae0255e.png) is disabled.

Select the branch that targets your version of Firefox.

- master > Nightly
- firefox-61 > Firefox 61 & 62.
- firefox-58 > Firefox 58, 59 & 60.

The firefox-58 branch has an incomplete theme, I have plans for back-porting features only to FF60 so I might end creating a ff60 branch.

### With Git

Go into your Firefox profile folder and clone the repo:
`git clone -b <branch> https://github.com/Guerra24/Firefox-UWP-Style.git chrome`

Replace `<branch>` with the one that targets your version of Firefox.

Now restart Firefox and the theme will be enabled.

### Without Git

Download the code of the branch as ZIP, copy the content inside the folder(where the userChrome.css file is located) into your chrome folder.

Now restart Firefox and the theme will be enabled.

## Tweaks

Check userChrome.css for customizable variables or restore elements.
