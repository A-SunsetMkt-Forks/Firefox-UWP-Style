# Firefox UWP Style

*Firefox UWP* is a more complete and robust theme that mimics UWP UI. Created with consistency and accuracy in mind, captures look and feel of UWP and brings it to Firefox. Based on *Firefox Dark-Flat UWP Style* theme, it expands the changes to context menus and most part of the UI.

Currently is in very early development.

## Install

In your `chrome` folder clone this repo from the branch that targets your version of Firefox:
- master > Nightly

Now restart Firefox and the theme will be enabled, if you want to disable parts of it open `userChrome.css` and remove or comment the `@import` line of the module that you want to disable.

## Updates

I will provide updates for the Firefox releases that have support, this mean if a Firefox release goes out of support I will stop providing updates for that release. By example: when F59 launches, F58 stops receiving updates and so the theme.
